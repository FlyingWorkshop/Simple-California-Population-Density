# Simple-California-Population-Density

This very simple python project was my first stab at doing a personal coding project outside of class. The topic of the project was inspired by a similar in-class example in CS 106A at Stanford (2020-2021 Fall Quarter) by Prof. Chris Piech. 

The goal of the project is to display a map of California's population density.
